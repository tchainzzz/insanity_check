# insanity_check.py

Inspired by the "sanitycheck" testing suites provided by the instructors in CS107 and CS110 at Stanford, the introductory computer systems courses, this script helps test for those pesky race conditions by repeatedly running sanitycheck ad infinitum, or rather, for however many iterations specified on the command line. Default is 10.

"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."
